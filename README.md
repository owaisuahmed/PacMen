# PacMen
PacMen Exercise Repository for xPro course

Description: This is an exercise in learning how to move and change images while detecting the left and right edges of the screen and keeping within them. When run, the output looks like the video game character PacMan moving back and forth between the left and right edges of the screen with its mouth opening and closing. Additional characters can be added with a button click.

Usage: Copy/download the files in the PacMen folder and then open index.html in a web browser. Click the "Add PacMan" button at the top left of the screen, and then click click the "Start Game" button. You should see something like the following:

Roadmap: This exercise can be improved in the future by adding features that will allow continuous animation when other PacMen are added to the screen. It can also include code to change the image of each character to match the direction in which it is traveling.
